# RePro: A Benchmark Dataset for Opinion Mining for Brazilian Portuguese

RePro, which stands for "REview of PROducts," is a benchmark dataset for opinion mining in Brazilian Portuguese. It consists of 10,000 humanly annotated e-commerce product reviews, each labeled with sentiment and topic information. The dataset was created based on data from one of the largest Brazilian e-commerce platforms, which produced the B2W-Reviews01 dataset (https://github.com/americanas-tech/b2w-reviews01). The RePro dataset aims to provide a valuable resource for tasks related to sentiment analysis and topic modeling in the context of Brazilian Portuguese e-commerce product reviews. It is designed to serve as a benchmark for future research in natural language processing and related fields.
